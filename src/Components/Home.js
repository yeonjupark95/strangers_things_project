          <p>In this space, you can buy and sell items.</p>
          <p>In order to avoid scams, please follow below rules:</p>
          <li>Do not provide payment to anyone you have not met in person.</li>
          <li>
            Never wire funds (e.g. Western Union) - anyone who asks you to is a
            scammer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't accept cashier/certified checks or money orders - banks cash
            fakes, then hold you responsible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Never give out financial info (bank account, social security, paypal
            account, etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not rent or purchase sight-unseenâ€”that amazing "deal" may not
            exist.
          </li>
          <p>Now go have fun and enjoy shopping! </p>
